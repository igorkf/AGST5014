__1. The following experiment comes from a central composite design 
with 4 factors in 2 blocks. Conduct the proper analysis (including graphs, interpretation, etc). __ 

```{r}
q1 <- read.csv("HW8_Q1.csv")
q1$block <- as.factor(q1$block)
str(q1)
```

__2. The design below presents the yield of different common bean cultivars.
There was a variable stand count in each plot. Conduct the proper analysis.__ 

```{r}
q2 <- read.csv("HW8_Q2.csv")
q2 <- transform(q2, block = as.factor(block), cv = as.factor(cv))
str(q2)
```

__3. Design a proper experiment to identify the best dose of Nitrogen and
amount of water to maximize yield (choose what values you would use). __
